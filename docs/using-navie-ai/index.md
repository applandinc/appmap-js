# Using Navie

AppMap Navie is designed to help developers solve issues and add features in their codebase by leveraging runtime data and AI-driven commands. By following a structured workflow, you can maximize Navieâ€™s capabilities to plan, generate, and verify your code changes with precision. This guide outlines the recommended workflow and provides an overview of the key command modes used throughout the process.

If you are not able to use the AppMap OpenAI proxy, you can bring your own OpenAI API key, or use an entirely different AI Model, [hosted in your environment](/docs/using-navie-ai/bring-your-own-model.html#azure-openai) or [hosted locally](/docs/using-navie-ai/bring-your-own-model.html#ollama).
