# Mermaid

Within AppMap Navie the `@diagram` command prefix focuses the AI response to generate Mermaid compatible diagrams.  [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is an open source diagramming and charting utility with wide support across tools such as GitHub, Atlassian, and more.  Use the `@diagram` command, and Navie will create and render a Mermaid compatible diagram within the Navie chat window.  You can open this diagram in the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live), copy the Mermaid Definitions to your clipboard, save to disk, or expand a full window view.  Save the Mermaid diagram into any supported tool such as GitHub Issues, Atlassian Confluence, and more.
