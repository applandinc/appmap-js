## Development

### Prerequisites

We use `yarn` to manage dependencies. As of the time this is written, yarn has
better support for projects with many `package.json` files. Secondly, we use
`lerna` to do some higher level management of packages within the monorepo.

Install both via `npm`:

```
$ npm install -g yarn lerna
```

### Getting started

Running `yarn` will install all dependencies and link projects together for
local development.

```
$ yarn
```
