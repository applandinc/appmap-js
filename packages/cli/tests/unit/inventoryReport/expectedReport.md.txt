AppMap runtime analysis is configurable. [Learn more about configuring AppMap runtime analysis](https://appmap.io/docs/guides/configuring-analysis.html).

<h4><a id="ws-api-profile">Web service API profile</a></h4>

When you record AppMaps that include HTTP server requests, AppMap can automatically generate OpenAPI definitions. 


This project has AppMaps that contain HTTP server requests. Here's a profile of the AppMaps that
include HTTP server requests:

| Number of HTTP server requests | Number of AppMaps |
| --- | --- |
| None | No AppMaps |
| Between 1 and 5 | 3 |
| More than 5 | 3 |

At a high level, here are the REST resources that are provided by this project:

`/` `/about` `/account_activations/{id}` `/contact` `/help` `/login` `/logout` `/microposts` `/microposts/{id}` `/password_resets` `/password_resets/new` `/password_resets/{id}` `/relationships` `/relationships/{id}` `/signup` `/users` `/users/{id}` 

And here are the different content types served by the API:

| Response Content Type | Number of Routes |
| --- | --- |
| text/html | 38 |
| text/javascript | 2 |

As you change your code and tests, AppMap will automatically update the OpenAPI definitions. 
You'll see a summary of the REST API changes in each pull request.
<h4><a id="sql-profile">SQL profile</a></h4>

When your code makes a SQL query, AppMap records the SQL query in detail. It even parses the queries
to figure out which tables your app is using, and how it's using them.


Here's a summary of how many SQL queries are in the AppMaps of this project:

| SQL queries | Number of AppMaps |
| --- | --- |
| None | 1 |
| Between 1 and 5 | 0 |
| More than 5 | 5 |


And here are all the SQL tables that are used by this project:

`active_storage_attachments` `active_storage_blobs` `microposts` `relationships` `sqlite_master` `sqlite_temp_master` `users`
