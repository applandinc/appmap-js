You've confirmed that your application process is running, but I'm unable to connect to the AppMap agent over HTTP. There are three common reasons for this:

1) The agent is enabled and reachable, but it's mounted to a non-root URL path (e.g. /myapp), or the application server is only requesting HTTPS connections.
2) The agent isn't configured to accept connections in this process. For example, the app isn't running with APPMAP=true (Ruby, Python), or the app isn't running with the AppMap agent enabled (Java).
3) The agent is enabled, but HTTP requests to the agent are being blocked by some application or framework code; for example, a security filter.

For case (1), you can configure the application URL path and protocol.

For case (2), you'll need to re-launch the server with the agent enabled.

For case (3), you should contact AppMap support for help with troubleshooting.
