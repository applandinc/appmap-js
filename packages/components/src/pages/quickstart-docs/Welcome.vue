            To record AppMaps you will need to install the AppMap agent for this
            project.

            I have an <b>AppMap file</b> and I want to open it

          <p>
            You have everything you need! Just add the file to a directory in
            this project, and click on it in the left hand sidebar as you
            normally would to open a file. The file will open automatically in
            the AppMap viewer.

            I received a <b>link to an AppMap</b> and I want to open it
          </h1>
          <p>
            Simply click the link you recieved, follow the prompt to log-in with
            a new or existing account, and you will be directed to the AppMap.
