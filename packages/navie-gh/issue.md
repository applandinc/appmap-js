### Summary of the Issue

#### High-Level Description of the Problem
The `appmap-python` library encounters an `IndexError: tuple index out of range` when running in a Python 3.9 environment. This problem arises due to an incompatibility between the reported Python environment (Python 3.9) and the codebase, initially tested against Python 2.6 through 3.5. The issue is exacerbated by AppMap's function call interception and wrapping logic, which adds complexity to exception handling.

#### High-Level Plan for How to Fix the Problem
1. **Update Compatibility Checks**:
   - Ensure `appmap-python` supports Python 3.9 and later versions by updating compatibility checks and required dependencies.

2. **Review and Update Exception Handling**:
   - Enhance the exception handling mechanism, particularly around function call wrapping and interception, to manage exceptions like `ArgumentIndexError` appropriately.

3. **Add Robustness to Function Interception**:
   - Improve the function interception logic to handle unexpected exceptions due to version differences, adding comprehensive try-catch blocks around critical sections.

4. **Comprehensive Testing Across Python Versions**:
   - Expand the test suite to include tests for Python 3.9 and other modern versions to ensure compatibility.

5. **Modify CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline to include newer Python versions, ensuring automated tests are executed for all supported versions.

#### Test Case Expected to Trigger the Problem
A generic test case that simulates a scenario where a function call is intercepted and an `ArgumentIndexError` is raised:

```python
import pytest

class ArgumentIndexError(ValueError):
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Argument index out of range: {self.args[1]} for {self.args[0]}"

def function_to_test(x, y):
    if x > y:
        raise ArgumentIndexError("x should not be greater than y", x, y)
    return x + y

def test_intercepted_function():
    with pytest.raises(ArgumentIndexError) as exc_info:
        function_to_test(5, 3)
    assert str(exc_info.value) == "Argument index out of range: 5 for x should not be greater than y"
```

This test case is designed to be generic and should trigger the `ArgumentIndexError` when run in an environment where `appmap-python` is intercepting function calls.
