Pruning works by finding the most repetitive calls within a given "chunk" and removing events
associated with those calls. A chunk is defined as a group of logic, consisting of one or more full
call stacks. Boundaries of these chunks are created around application entrypoints such as inbound
HTTP request.

An example list of chunks is provided below:

```
HTTP request - GET /user
Background thread processing
HTTP request - PUT /user
Background thread processing
HTTP request - GET /
```

For each chunk, aggregate the total number of unique events. Starting from the most repetitive event
type, remove instances of that event until the size of the chunk (in byte) is less than:

```
requested size / total event array size * starting chunk size
```

In essence, we're calculating a unique exclusion list for each chunk. This prevents an excessively
noisy or repetitive call stack in one area of execution from affecting the results of unrelated
areas of execution.

Non-application events such as HTTP requests and SQL queries will always be retained. This means
that the end result can never be smaller than the total size of these events combined.
